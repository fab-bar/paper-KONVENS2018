# POS tagging texts with spelling variation

Scripts to run POS tagging experiments with historical German texts that contain spelling variants.

## Install dependencies

Script to install the tools needed for the experiments.
For tools under version control, the version used for the experiments in the paper is checked out.

- install_dependencies.sh:
  Download and build the following tools in the folder lib/

  - SpellvarDetection (https://github.com/fab-bar/spellvardetection)
  - csmtiser (https://github.com/clarinsi/csmtiser)
  - hyperwords (https://bitbucket.org/omerlevy/hyperwords)
  - fastText (https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText)
  - TreeTagger (https://www.cis.uni-muenchen.de/~schmid/tools/TreeTagger/)
  - RFTagger (https://www.cis.uni-muenchen.de/~schmid/tools/RFTagger/)
  - HunPos (https://github.com/mivoq/hunpos)

## Data

Scripts to get and prepare the data used for the POS tagging experiments.

- prepare_re[mn].sh:
  Download and prepare the data from ReM/ReN.
  Data is split in train, test, devel and background corpus (for creation of embeddings)

  - ReM is version 1.0 (islrn.org/resources/332-536-136-099-5)
  - ReN is version 0.6 (http://hdl.handle.net/11022/0000-0007-C64C-5)

Run prepare_re[mn].sh to extract the data and remove texts not used for the experiments.

- create_embeddings.sh
- create_normalization.sh
- create_spellvars.sh

Run the create_* scripts to create the embeddings, automatic normalizations and automatically detected spelling variants for ReM and ReN that are used in the experiments.
